# SCSS File Structure

* Initial File Comment
* Imports
* Variable Definitions
* Native Tag Styles
* Global / Extendable styles
* File specific styles


Generally styles defined in global styles can be used in conjunction with other styles from
other files in the html. Otherwise they are extended within the parent file styles.
